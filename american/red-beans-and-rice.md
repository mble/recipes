# Red Beans and Rice

Adapted from the wonderful [Gumbo Pages](https://gumbopages.com/food/red-beans.html). Make on a Sunday, serve on Monday - as God and Louis Armstrong intended.

## Servings

8 generous servings.

## Ingredients

- 450g red kidney beans, dry
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1 large green bell pepper, chopped
- 5 stalks celery, chopped
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 340g of [pickle meat](https://gumbopages.com/food/pickle-meat.html) or smoked ham hocks
- 450g of andouille sausage, sliced on the bias
- 5 dashes of Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 2 bay leaves
- Hot sauce (Crystal or Tabasco) to taste
- [Creole seasoning](https://gumbopages.com/food/creole.html) to taste
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Rice, basmati

## Method

1. Soak beans overnight in cold water, 1 litre.
2. Drain beans, add to large heavy bottomed pot with 1 litre of water. Beans must remain covered with water. Boil the hell out of them for one hour.
3. Sauté onion, bell pepper and celery (the _holy trinity_) in a separate pan until onions are translucent.
4. Add garlic and sauté for 2 minutes.
5. Add the onion, bell pepper, celery and garlic to the beans.
6. Add pickle meat or ham hocks, andouille sausage, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, bay leaves, hot sauce, Creole seasoning, salt and pepper.
7. Simmer for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. Add water as needed to keep beans covered. Desired texture is creamy, not as thick as refried beans.
8. Bring to room temperature, refrigerate overnight.
9. Reheat ~250g of beans, adding water as needed to keep beans creamy.
10. Serve over rice, about ~120g worth.

I _really_ like this, as Chuck does, with pickled onions (the pearl/silverskin kind, not the pink ones). ALternatively, a splash of white vinegar will do the trick.
