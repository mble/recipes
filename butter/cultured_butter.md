# Cultured Butter

What could be more wonderful than yellow gold, cultured butter? Straightforward to make, and produces buttermilk as a side effect, which is somewhat hard to get in the UK.

## Servings

~500g of cultured butter
~500g of cultured buttermilk

## Ingredients

|                                              | Weight |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 40% fat high quality double cream            | 1000g  |
| "Live" sour cream, crème fraîche, or yoghurt | 100g   |
| Sea salt                                     | 20g    |

## Method

1. In a **clean** bowl, mix together double cream and starter culture until fully incorporated.
2. Cover the bowl with muslin/cheesecloth and leave at room temperature (25C) for ~20 hours.
3. Replace the muslin/cheesecloth with clingfilm and place the bowl into the fridge for ~20 hours.
4. Remove the bowl from the fridge and leave at room temperature for 1 hour, until warmed until 8C – 14C.
5. Add mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer. Fix the whisk attachment. Ensure the bowl is no more than half full.
6. Start whisking on low (2 on a Kitchenaid), then move to medium-high (6 on a Kitchenaid).
7. Set up a bowl of ice water.
8. Wait until the mixture completely inverts.
   - Popcorn butter (yellow globules) form.
   - Buttermilk (pale liquid) remains.
9. Strain through a sieve, reserving both popcorn butter and buttermilk.
   - Buttermilk will keep for ~12 days in the fridge.
10. Quickly knead the popcorn butter on a cold, clean surface using the heels of your hands. Ensure hands are cold with ice water.
11. When no more buttermilk is expelled, knead in salt to taste until final excess of moisture is expelled.
12. Divide into 5 equal pieces and form into 5 ~100g pucks. Wrap in wax paper and store in the fridge for up to 3 weeks.
