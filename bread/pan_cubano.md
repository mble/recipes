# Pan Cubano

_Pan Cubano_, Cuban Bread, is the essential ingredient to the sandwich of the same name. It should have a paper thin, shattering crust with a tender, closed crumb.

We use a pre-ferment for flavour development, and include the traditional ingredient of lard as a fat source. For baking, steam is key. In order to accomplish this, either cover it with a disposable roasting tin or introduce steam via misting and a pan of water at the bottom of the oven.

A _pan medianoche_ can be made based on this recipe, adding eggs and sugar for a sweetened, enriched bread.

## Components

### Pre-ferment

60g water
60g bread flour
2g instant yeast

### Dough

375g bread flour
8g instant yeast
6g fine sea salt
240g water
50g lard @ 20C – 23C

## Method

A note: this takes place over ~24 hours, with about 12-16 hours of developing the pre-ferment.

### Pre-ferment

1. Mix together bread flour, water and yeast in a non-reactive bowl.
2. Cover with cling film and leave at room temperature (20C – 22C) for 12-16 hours.

### Dough

1. Dissolve salt into 25g of water, set aside.
2. Bloom yeast in 100g of water @ 27C for 10 minutes.
3. Whisk together bread flour and yeast (and sugar if you are using) in a bowl of a stand mixer.
4. Add pre-ferment, lard, water and salt and water mixture.
5. Mix together on low (2 on a Kitchenaid) for 5 to 8 minutes until fully incorporated and no dry flour remains.
6. Increase speed to medium (6 on Kitchenaid) for 8 minutes, until dough clears the sides of bowl.
7. Grease a non-reactive bowl.
8. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and shape into a ball, developing some surface tension.
9. Place seam-side down into the greased bowl, cover with a damp tea towel.
10. Place bowl into a warm area (25C – 30C) to rise for 45 minutes – 1 hour.
11. Prepare baking sheets with parchment paper.
12. Preheat oven to 230C.
13. Degas and turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface and divide into 2 even pieces, ~400g each.
14. Shape each piece into a tapered loaf, around 40cm in length.
    - Flatten dough into a 25cm x 15cm rectangle, with the long side parallel to the work surface edge.
    - Fold the top edge to the midline, press to seal.
    - Fold the bottom edge to the midline, press to seal.
    - Bring top and bottom edges together, press along the team to the tips to seal.
    - Flip dough seam-side down, gently roll into a 38cm – 40cm tapered loaf.
15. Place the loaves on the baking sheet, 7cm apart.
16. Cover the loaves loosely with cling film, proof at room temperature (20C – 23C) for 30 – 45 minutes until doubled in size.
17. Lightly score (~0.3cm depth) the middle of each loaf lengthwise with a sharp knife, lame or razor blade, stopping about 5cm from each end.
18. Cover loaves with the disposable roasting tin, or mist lightly with cold water and fill an oven-safe pan with water and add to the bottom rack of the oven.
19. Bake at 230C for 20 minutes.
    - If using the disposable tin, remove the tin with tongs.
    - If introducing mist, mist the inside of the oven after the loaves have been placed inside and quickly shut the oven door.
20. Bake for a further 10 minutes, until the loaves are a light golden brown and the inside temperature registers 98C on an instant read thermometer.
    – Watch yourself if introducing steam!
21. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely if using for sandwiches, or for 30 – 45 minutes to eat warm.

## Notes

The key here is a tender crumb with the crust that should shatter. If making a Cuban sandwich, remember to butter the outside of the bread and toast with a heavy weight on top, or use a _plancha_ if you've got it.
