# Focaccia

This is a 72 hour, lazy Sunday focaccia. A pre-ferment (a _poolish_) is used as a source of leavening and flavour development, which is aided by the long cold proofing time. Good olive oil helps here.

82.6% hydration

You can add toppings, such as sliced grape tomatoes or pitted olives, but my preference is flaky sea salt, thyme and rosemary.

## Servings

8 - 10 generous portions

## Method

A note: this takes place over ~72 hours. Good to start Friday night and bake Sunday morning.

### _Poolish_

1. Mix together bread flour, water and yeast in a non-reative bowl.
2. Cover with cling film and leave at room temperature (23C) for 12–16 hours.

### Dough

1. Dissolve salt into 50g of water, set aside.
2. Bloom yeast in 100g of water @ 30C for 10 minutes.
3. Mix together poolish, bread flour, water and yeast and water mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer.
4. Affix dough hook to stand mixer, and mix on low (2 on a Kitchenaid) for 5 minutes or until homogenous. Rest 20 minutes.
5. Add salt and water mixture, mix on medium speed (6 on a Kitchenaid) for 5 minutes until smooth and the dough pulls away from the bowl.
6. Oil up a tub or sufficiently large roasting tin with 75-100g of olive oil.
7. Move dough into the oiled tub/tin and rest 1 hour.
8. Stretch and fold, then rest one hour.
   - This is hard to describe in text. With oiled hands, scoop the middle of the dough up and pull towards you. The side furthest away from you will pull to meet the edge closest to you, then place the dough you are holding at the end of the tub/tin furthest away from you. Rotate the tub/tin 180 degrees, repeat. Rotate the tub/tin 90 degrees, repeat.
9. Repeat step 8. If you cannot see oil around the dough, add more oil.
10. Cover tub/tin with oiled cling film, and place in the fridge for at least 12 hours, up to 24 hours. For the first two hours, check once and hour and degas if needed.
11. Stretch/massage dough onto a baking sheet lined with oiled parchment.
12. Proof covered, with another baking sheet or loosely placed oiled cling film, at room temperature (23C) for ~1 hour. Dough should be very wobbly and puffed up.
13. Preheat oven to the maximum for your oven.
14. With oiled hands, dimple the surface of the dough, about 3/4 of the way into the dough. Be gentle – we don't want to degas it.
15. Liberally coat with remaining olive oil and dimple again.
16. Add desired toppings. For the rosemary, thyme and salt, combine 3 sprigs of rosemary, 3 sprigs of thyme and two good pinches of salt in a bowl, mix and then evenly cover the dough with the mixture, gently pressing into the surface.
17. Place into the oven and immediately turn the oven down to 240C and bake for 10 minutes.
18. Turn oven down to 230C and bake for another 20-25 minutes, until a deep golden brown, rotating 180 degrees halfway through.
19. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.

## Notes

Focaccia, despite the high hydration and oil content, does not stay fresh for long – it is best eaten the day of, and maybe the day after. I recommend sharing this amongst at least 4 people, and makes a good gift for neighbours – it's vegan, though not gluten free.

I like this with ricotta, warm olive oil and a little lemon zest. It also makes for a bloody great sandwich – sun-dried tomatoes, fresh mozzerella and basil are my pick.
