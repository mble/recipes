# Buns

Enriched dough (egg and butter). Brioche/_pain au lait_ hybrid. Similar to _shokupan_ + butter. 61% hydration.

Don't skimp on the milk, eggs, or butter. Use the good stuff. I like: The Estate Dairy for milk, Cacklebean or Rhug Estate for eggs and President for butter.

## Servings

Makes 6 ~100g buns.

## Components

### _Tangzhong_

20g Bread flour  
27g Water  
60g Whole milk

### Dough

120g Whole milk @ 30C  
9g Instant yeast  
320g Bread flour  
7g Fine sea salt  
35g Granulated sugar  
1 Large egg, yolk and white  
1 Large egg, yolk  
42g unsalted butter @ 23C

### Egg wash:

1 Large egg, yolk and white  
10g Whole milk

## Method

### _Tangzhong_

1. Add _tangzhong_ ingredients to a small saucepan. Whisk constantly over medium-low until mixture reaches 65C and mixture resembles American-style mashed potatoes.
2. Allow to cool to room temperature (~23C)

### Dough

1. Heat milk to 30C and add yeast. Stir together and rest 10 minutes.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together flour sugar and salt until homogenous.
3. Fix dough hook to mixer, set bowl in mixer, and start on low speed (2 on a Kitchenaid).
4. Add _tangzhong_ paste.
5. Add milk and yeast mixture.
6. Add egg and egg yolk.
7. Increase speed to medium-low (4 on a Kitchenaid) until incorporated.
8. Add softened butter 6g at a time, waiting until butter is incorporated before adding the next pad.
9. Knead on medium-low for 5-8 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic.
10. Stop mixer and scrape dough onto an un-floured worksurface.
11. Shape into a ball, developing some surface tension.
12. Place seam-side down into an oiled/buttered bowl and cover with a damp tea towel.
13. Place bowl into a warm area (25C – 30C) for 1.5 hours.
14. Once dough is doubled in size, degas and divide into 6 even pieces, ~100g each.
15. Shape each piece into taut balls.
    - Pinch and stretch a section of dough away from you, then pull into the centre. Rotate dough 60 degrees and repeat 5 more times. Turn seam-side down and create further tension by pulling the dough ball towards you, then rotate 60 degrees and repeat 5 more times.
16. Place dough balls onto a rimmed baking sheet lined with lightly greased parchment paper. Take into account space for two sets of rising – proofing and baking.
17. Preheat oven to 190C.
18. Cover lightly with greased cling film or another baking sheet and proof at room temperature/23C, for 1–2 hours.
19. Brush whole exposed surface with egg wash.
20. Bake at 190C for 16-18 minutes until a deep golden brown, close to a chestnut brown.
21. Brush with melted butter.
22. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.

## Notes

These buns stay soft and squishy for up to a week thanks to the _tangzhong_, and I find they are even better after a day of rest, but so aren't we all.

I've previously made these with half the sugar, and although less sweet, lacked the characteristic chestnut colour and were somewhat more crumbly.

As an experiment, I want to try this recipe with honey instead of sugar.
